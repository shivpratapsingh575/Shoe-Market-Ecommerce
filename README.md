# Shoe-Market-Ecommerce

I developed an e-commerce website called Shoe Market using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to browse shoes for men, women, and kids, explore offers and featured collections, and view details of different brands.
The site is fully responsive and includes sections like Customer Care, Product Help, and Authorized Service to enhance the shopping experience.
